        Users can create, edit, and delete project entries.
        Projects have fields for project name, description, technology stack used, and a link to the project's repository (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, etc.).

    Activity Tracking:
        Users can log activities related to their projects, such as code commits, issues closed, pull requests merged, and documentation updates.
        DevRank calculates a project's activity score based on these logged activities.

        Users can upvote or endorse projects they find valuable, contributing to a project's ranking.

    Notifications and Alerts:
        Users receive notifications about project activity, such as new followers, comments, or project ranking changes.

    Search and Discovery:
        Users can search for projects based on keywords, technologies, or developer names.
        A recommendation system suggests projects to users based on their interests and activity history.

    Analytics and Insights:
        Users can access detailed analytics about their project's activity over time, helping them make data-driven decisions.
